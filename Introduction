CI/CD 
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery( When Deployment Process needs an Approval)
Continuous Deployment( Most Probably Defined as Automatic Deployment without any Approvals)

A Process which Involves Mutiple Stages/Steps that need to be performed inorder to test and deploy an application code.
Stages involve Pulling Updated Code from SCM, Performing Different types of Test(Involves Testing Tools), Generating Reports, Building Artifacts,Adding Dependencies ,Deploying into Docker/Kubernetes etc.

In order to Automate above all Process, we are using CI/CD Tools.
Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code" via the Pipeline domain-specific language (DSL) syntax. 
Tools most used in Market are Jenkins, AgroCD, razaropsCD etc..

Main focus will be on Jenkins.
RoadMap: 
 1. Understand the Architecture of Jenkins( Master & Slave Nodes Diagram)
 2. Deep Dive into the Concept of Pipelines ( Different types of Pipelines,Syntax, Jenkinsfile for Pipeline etc )
 3. Build Pipelines from Scratch (Eg: Stage 1 SCM Checkout - Pipeline should look for Changes/Commits into Target Repo and Pull them, Stage 2: Any Testing Tool to Perform some testing, Stage 3: Deploy into Docker for Accessing from Web etc )
 4. Do Projects to Include in Resume( Checkout Best Projects to add value in Resume)
